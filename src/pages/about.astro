                WHERE I'M FROM
                <p>Hi there! I'm from Cebu, PH, the first in my family to go to college, raised by my hardworking single mom who worked as a maid. Despite being told to get off the computer growing up, I fell in love with it early on, especially playing video games â€“ earning me the title of the family's 'techie-kid.'</p>
                WHAT I USED TO DO
                <p>My tech journey started in a cozy pisonet (like a mini internet cafe). Curiosity led me to play around with computers, and soon I was teaching myself photo and video editing, working on design projects for friends and schools.</p>
                WHAT I DO NOW
                <p>Currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science at the Asian College of Technology, my focus lies in Full-Stack Development, with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Game Development. I like exploring and learning different technologies, and enrolling to various courses to improve my skills. I care a lot about using code for positive impact. I'm also a graphics designer for the non-profit organization 'Ngiti.</p>
                <p>                    When I'm not coding and designing, you'll often find me casually playing TFT and League of Legends or consuming tech contents on YouTube</p>
