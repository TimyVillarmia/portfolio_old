            <p class="font-normal whitespace-pre-line text-justify">
                I was born and raised in Cebu, PH., the first in my family to attend college, raised by my hardworking single mother who worked as a maid. I got hooked on computers early on and loved playing video games and turned me into a "techie-kid" of the family early on.
                
                In my teenage years, curiosity led me to self-taught photo and video editing, taking on design projects for friends and schools. 
                
                Today, I&rsquo;m currently a 3rd-year computer science student at Asian College of Technology. While I primarily focus on the Full-Stack Development, I have a great interest in Artificial Intelligence and Game-Development. I proudly serve as a graphics designer for the non-profit organization "Ngiti”.
                
                When I'm not coding and designing, you'll often find me casually playing TFT and League of Legends or consuming tech contents on YouTube
                
                I&rsquo;m open to internships, and part-time positions in the Full-Stack Development field.
